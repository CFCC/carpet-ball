# Carpet-ball
This project was developed at [Camp Fitch Computer Camp](http://campcomputer.com) which is part of Youngstown, Ohio YMCA's [Camp Fitch](http://www.campfitchymca.org).

Carpet Ball is a fun game enjoyed by campers and staff alike involving 2 people rolling a cue ball across a strip of carpet to knock down the other person's billiard balls. We hope you enjoy this version!

It was a collaboration between many campers, and we're proud of all the progress they made in such a short time.
